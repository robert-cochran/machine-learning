1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
In this specialization, you will learn how to do

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,195
machine learning at scale and how to build

3
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:11,965
specialized machine-learning models for images, sequences, and recommendations.

4
00:00:11,965 --> 00:00:16,460
Hi I'm Lak, I lead the team that put together this specialization.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,330
We start with a course that recaps the first specialization.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,570
It involves building an end-to-end model from

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,810
data exploration all the way to deploying an ML model and getting predictions from it.

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,510
The second course is on building production machine learning models.

9
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,940
The considerations behind them, static training,

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,925
dynamic training, static inference,

11
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:45,100
dynamic inference, distributed TensorFlow.

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,890
TensorFlow processing units, when would you use what.

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,635
The third course is on building image models.

14
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,760
You will learn about convolutional neural networks and

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,310
build image classification models of various types.

16
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,365
The fourth course is on building sequence models.

17
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:05,420
These are the types of models used in

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,035
natural language problems like text classification and translation.

19
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:13,385
There can also be used for time series forecasting.

20
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:16,370
Although as we'll see in this course it's

21
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,240
often overkill and hard to train for this purpose.

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,165
Finally, we end the specialization with building real-world recommendation systems.

23
00:01:27,165 --> 00:01:30,800
This brings together all the concepts that we will have

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,390
learned in both the previous specialization and in this one.

25
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,520
I'm excited to have you join me.
