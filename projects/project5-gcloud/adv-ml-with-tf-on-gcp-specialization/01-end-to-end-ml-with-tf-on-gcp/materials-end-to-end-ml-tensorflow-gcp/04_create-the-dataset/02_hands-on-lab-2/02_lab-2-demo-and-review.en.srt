1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,720
What field should you use the hash on?

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,900
You want it to be randomly
spread throughout.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:11,810
You cannot split by year because baby's
weights actually have a long-term trend.

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,446
Check it out, it's in the data.

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:16,650
I'd suggest a concatenated
string of year and month.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,350
In this lab, you sample the full Big Query
dataset to create a smaller dataset for

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,780
model development and for local training.

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,170
Make sure that this smaller dataset is
representative of the full dataset.
