What field should you use the hash on? You want it to be randomly
spread throughout. You cannot split by year because baby's
weights actually have a long-term trend. Check it out, it's in the data. I'd suggest a concatenated
string of year and month. In this lab, you sample the full Big Query
dataset to create a smaller dataset for model development and for local training. Make sure that this smaller dataset is
representative of the full dataset.
