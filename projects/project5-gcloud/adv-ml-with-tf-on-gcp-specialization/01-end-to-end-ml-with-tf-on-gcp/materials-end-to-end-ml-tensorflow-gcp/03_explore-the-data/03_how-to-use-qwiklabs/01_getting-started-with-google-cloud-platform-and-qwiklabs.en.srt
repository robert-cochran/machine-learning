1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,525
Hello and welcome again to the course.

2
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:04,340
Before we get too deep into the lectures here,

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,070
I want to preview the interactive hands-on labs platform called Qwiklabs and how

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,160
you'll actually be practicing a lot of the things that you're going to learn

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,965
here inside of real Google Cloud Platform accounts.

6
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:16,825
But you don't need your own credentials as they're actually going to be provided for you.

7
00:00:16,825 --> 00:00:19,200
So, let's take a look at how the labs platform is setup.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,855
Inside of Coursera, you're actually going to see

9
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,405
a lab or an item that's marked out for an external tool to open up,

10
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:27,150
and you're going to click on that tool.

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,410
After that, you're going to see a "Start Lab" button in green and

12
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,840
a timer associated with it for you to complete the lab in that duration.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,440
After you click that "Start Lab" credentials for your student accounts

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,150
are automatically going to be provided to you and a new box that's going to pop up.

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,470
In addition, there's to be another button that says,

16
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,690
"Open Google Console", in yellow,

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,020
and once you open that up,

18
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,645
that's going to ask you to log into the Google Cloud platform,

19
00:00:49,645 --> 00:00:51,690
with the key caveat that you logging in with

20
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,015
a student account and not your own personal account should you already have one setup.

21
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:58,290
Last but not least, we'll do a few demos and

22
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,620
walkthroughs of what the UI looks like. So, let's take a look.

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,320
So, inside an example Coursera course,

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,400
you're going to come across a lab that looks something like this.

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,120
This is just an example, this is Lab zero

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,955
but it could be any of the labs that you might find.

27
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:12,550
Once you've clicked on that,

28
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:17,300
you'll see a checkbox that's going to authorize the lab to run,

29
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,550
and you accept the terms and conditions for Coursera,

30
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,430
and you click on "Open Tool".

31
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,940
Once you click, "Open Tool",

32
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,070
it's going to bring you to the Qwiklabs environment,

33
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,580
and there're couple of key things to notice here.

34
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,050
On the right-hand side is your instructions pane for the actual lab.

35
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,765
This lab's a mental lab, it's all about Qwiklabs in general.

36
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:35,250
But whatever your course is,

37
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,460
this is where the instructions for completing the lab are going to take place.

38
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,070
So, you always want to keep this prompt, open.

39
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,700
Now, once you actually click, "Start Lab",

40
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,730
a provisioned instance of the Google Cloud Platform complete

41
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,380
with any additional instances,

42
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,890
or say you're working with VMs,

43
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,525
if there's something that the lab provider wanted you to have,

44
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:57,985
it's actually going to be created inside of this lab instance for you.

45
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,170
Which is a great, it says "Send Box" instance.

46
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,795
Now, once you notice I click "Start Lab",

47
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:04,860
I have 15 minutes to complete this lab and I promise you that the timers are

48
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,040
going to be associated with additional padding for the labs that you're going to do.

49
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,600
This is not going to mean it takes us 15 minutes,

50
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,115
so it'll takes us about five minutes.

51
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:12,720
Now as I mentioned before,

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,815
you have the username and password and a Project ID.

53
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:19,620
What I'll ask you to do now is click on "Open Google Console",

54
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,950
and once you've opened Google Console,

55
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,480
you'll be asked to sign in with your email.

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,310
Now, the key thing here is, if you used Google Resources before,

57
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,860
immediately you'll start typing in your personal email, I do it all the time.

58
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,000
Make sure you go back to

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,280
your lab credentials screen and copy and paste the username that's auto-generated fused.

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,070
It's going to be unique for you and it's

61
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,140
actually going to be unique for every lab that you run.

62
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,910
So, it'll be creating a new student account for each lab that you run.

63
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,130
Copy and paste that password, it's going to be different from mine,

64
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,860
so don't worry about copying that down.

65
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,150
Click "Next" in your browser,

66
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,380
paste in that password,

67
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:59,620
accept the terms, don't worry about setting up a secondary phone number,

68
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,975
accept the terms of the Google Cloud Platform.

69
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:06,535
Once you see a screen that looks like this, then you're good to go.

70
00:03:06,535 --> 00:03:08,870
Make sure, key tidbit.

71
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,910
If this is your project's selector,

72
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,305
it should be this auto-generated Qwiklabs alphanumeric.

73
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:16,760
If you should happen to see something that says either,

74
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,525
"Select A Project", or if you see something that says, "Qwiklabs Resources",

75
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:23,490
you actually want to click on this and make sure to

76
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,120
select your alphanumeric Qwiklabs ID and then go ahead and hit "Open".

77
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,145
Once you're within here, you're good to go.

78
00:03:29,145 --> 00:03:30,860
So, follow the instructions for the rest of the lab.

79
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,010
It's going to guide you through

80
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,195
what products and services that you're going to be working with.

81
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:37,810
You can access the menu of products and services in the upper-left-hand corner here,

82
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,070
or if it's a lab that's working for CloudShell, all the way up here,

83
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,350
is the button activate CloudShell which will bring open

84
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,975
that terminal instance for Google Cloud Platform.

85
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,390
Last few things. Back here,

86
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,835
you'll see that our timer's automatically running still.

87
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:52,680
Once you're completed with the lab,

88
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,985
you're done with it,

89
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:56,580
or if you wanted to take another attempt at the lab,

90
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,325
you have upwards of three attempts per lab, which is great.

91
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:01,700
So say, you want to run through the lab very quickly the first time,

92
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,100
and then experiment and explore with it the second time,

93
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,280
you're welcome to do that for a couple of times.

94
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,000
Now, make sure in order to get your completion stats properly recorded,

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,385
click on "End Lab",

96
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,095
you'll be faced with a prompt that says, "Are you all done".

97
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:15,415
Once you click "End Lab",

98
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:17,275
your project, any datasets,

99
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:18,800
anything that you've been working with inside of

100
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,500
this sandbox project, is going to be deleted.

101
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,870
So, make sure if you have any queries that you're running or

102
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,820
any interesting notes that you have saved inside

103
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,035
you to Google Cloud Platform Qwiklabs account,

104
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:31,095
that you copy and paste those and save them somewhere else,

105
00:04:31,095 --> 00:04:33,920
perhaps in your own personal Google Cloud Platform account,

106
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,710
or somewhere locally on your machine.

107
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,595
Once you've clicked "End Lab",

108
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:39,910
then you can enter feedback for the lab,

109
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,505
and you can continue moving on with rest of the courses in Coursera.

110
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:44,050
So again, quick recap.

111
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,620
One of the key things to remember is,

112
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,875
click on" Open Tool",

113
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,315
that'll open up Qwiklab.

114
00:04:48,315 --> 00:04:51,440
The second is, in order to get those credentials here on the left-hand side,

115
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,230
you have to click "Start Lab" which again kicks off the timer,

116
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,480
and there's no way to pause once that lab is started.

117
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,590
But again, keep in mind you have multiple attempts.

118
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,840
Lastly, click on "End Lab" when you're ready

119
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,565
to complete out the lab that you've been working on.

120
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:07,250
That's it, good luck with the labs that come later on, and enjoy the course.
