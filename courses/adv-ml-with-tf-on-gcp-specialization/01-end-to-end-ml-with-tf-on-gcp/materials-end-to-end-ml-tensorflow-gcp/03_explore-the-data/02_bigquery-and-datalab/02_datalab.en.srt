1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Besides BigQuery, the other piece of technology

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,245
you will use in the first lab is Cloud Datalab.

3
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:11,610
This is the Jupiter notebook that you can use to run Python code.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,430
It handles authentication to GCP,

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,200
so that you can easily access BigQuery.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,650
Datalab notebooks are developed in an iterative collaborative process.

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,030
You can write code in Python.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,820
You can hit the Run button,

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,795
and the output shows up right on the page itself.

10
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:33,610
Along with the code,

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:39,010
you can write commentary in markdown format and share the notebook with your colleagues.

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,750
This is what the user interface looks like;

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,185
number 1 is a Python code.

14
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:46,475
In this case, it's a plot command.

15
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:48,735
So, when you hit the Run button,

16
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:51,510
you get the graph as shown by Number 3.

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,830
You can add Markdown text that's shown in number

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,210
4 and share the notebook and that's number 5.

19
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,300
Datalab works with the same technologies you're familiar with,

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,990
so you can start developing now and then work on scale later.

21
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,430
For example, we will be doing an exercise where we read

22
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,910
from a CSV File and then you can process the data

23
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,790
in Pandas and Apache Beam before training

24
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,090
your model in TensorFlow and then improve the model to through training.

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,110
Eventually though, when you're ready to scale,

26
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,530
you can use Google Cloud Storage to hold your data initially.

27
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,340
Process it in Cloud Dataflow on an ephemeral cluster,

28
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:38,190
and then run distributed training and hyper-parameter optimization on Cloud ML Engine.

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,335
Cloud also frees you from being constrained by

30
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:45,320
hardware limitations not only can you run

31
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,619
Datalab on any Compute Engine instance that you want,

32
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:52,085
you can also change the machine specs after it's been provisioned.

33
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:55,235
You can go into the web console find the running VM

34
00:01:55,235 --> 00:01:58,925
stop it and restart it with a new machine configuration.

35
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:01,915
As a developer, to work in Datalab,

36
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:05,895
you simply connect to the VM that's running the notebook server.

37
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:11,865
The notebook themselves can be persisted in Git or in a Cloud repository,

38
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,820
so you can delete the VM if you don't need it anymore.

39
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,605
When you run the notebook,

40
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:22,205
the computation is carried out on the Compute Engine instance.

41
00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:25,960
To Start Up Cloud Datalab,

42
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,655
you go into Cloud Shell and you type in Datalab create.

43
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:34,300
If you have G-Cloud installed on your local computer,

44
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,640
you can run this Datalab create command from

45
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,770
your own computer instead of from Cloud Shell.

46
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,145
Finally, if you prefer some other Jupiter environment,

47
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:48,815
perhaps you use Jupiter lab or you use Colab from Google.

48
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:52,120
Py Datalab is available as a Python package,

49
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,570
you can simply install the package and you can get all of

50
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:02,690
the GCP authentication things that we rely on in parts of this course.
