00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,810
The goal of this lab is to investigate

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,190
which features have influence on what
you want to predict the baby's weight.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,710
For example, if you want to know
whether the field plurality or

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,680
the field is male has some
influence on the weight,

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,730
you can generate a bar chart for
the average weight of babies

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,542
sharing the same plurality value,
or the same is male value.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,150
However, it's not enough to just check

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,820
whether the average weight of the baby in
these different conditions is different.

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,520
Normally, you would also look at
the whole distribution of values.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,650
Checking the number of babies for
each value is necessary

11
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,860
because if you don't have enough sample
data for any range of input values,

12
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,420
predictions using those values
may not be very accurate either.

13
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,370
So go ahead, do lab number one.

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,885
And when you come back, my colleague
Chris will walk you through the solution.
