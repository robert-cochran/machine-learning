00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Hello. I'm Lak.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,085
I lead the team that is putting together

3
00:00:05,085 --> 00:00:09,735
the advanced machine learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform.

4
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:13,405
This is the first course of this specialization.

5
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:17,920
In this course, we will recap what we learned in the previous specialization.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,155
That specialization is called machine learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform.

7
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,080
This one has advanced in the name.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,470
One of the best ways to review something is

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,875
to work with the concepts and technologies that you have learned.

10
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,320
So this course is set up as a workshop.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,570
In this workshop, you will do end-to-end machine

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,120
learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,355
You will learn how to explore large datasets for features,

14
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:51,035
create training and evaluation datasets,

15
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:56,245
build models with the Estimator API in TensorFlow,

16
00:00:56,245 --> 00:01:00,710
train at scale and deploy those models into

17
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,895
production with Google Cloud Platform machine learning tools.

18
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:09,050
In this workshop, we walk through

19
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,725
the process of building a complete machine learning pipeline.

20
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:17,025
So, it covers ingest, exploration,

21
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:21,520
training, evaluation, deployment, and prediction.

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,985
So, the course consists of seven labs and it's primarily hands-on.

23
00:01:26,985 --> 00:01:32,480
The way it works is that we will quickly review the key concepts that

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,895
you will need for the following lab and then we will drop you off into the lab.

25
00:01:37,895 --> 00:01:41,080
Do the lab and then come back.

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:47,515
We will recap the lab and then move on to the next set of concepts and the next lab.

27
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:49,365
So, along the way,

28
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:51,105
you explore the data,

29
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:53,255
visualize the dataset, pick

30
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:56,790
features for your machine learning model. That's the first lab.

31
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,105
Then, in the second lab,

32
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:05,345
you create a sample dataset so that you can do local development of a TensorFlow model.

33
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:07,165
In the third lab,

34
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:10,955
you will develop a TensorFlow Estimator API model.

35
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:14,780
At this point, we have the prototype in place.

36
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,035
Once we have the prototype in place,

37
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:20,070
we will change over to productionization.

38
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,285
The first step of productionization is to

39
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:27,505
create full-sized training and evaluation datasets.

40
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:29,080
In order to do that,

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,450
the pre-processing operations will be implemented in

42
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,990
Cloud Dataflow so that the same pre-processing that

43
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:43,365
you apply during training can be applied during prediction in streaming mode as well.

44
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:47,005
The fifth lab is to train the model.

45
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:53,795
The training of the model will be distributed and scaled out on Cloud ML Engine.

46
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:55,910
In the sixth lab,

47
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:01,425
the trained model will be deployed as a micro service and in the seventh lab,

48
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:05,185
predictions invoked from a web application.

49
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,320
So, let's get started.
