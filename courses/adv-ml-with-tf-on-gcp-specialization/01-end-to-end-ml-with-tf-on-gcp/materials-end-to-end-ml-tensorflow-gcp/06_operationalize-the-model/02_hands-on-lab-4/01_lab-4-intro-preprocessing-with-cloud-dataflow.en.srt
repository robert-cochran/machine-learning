00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
In this lab, we will be doing preprocessing using Cloud Dataflow,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,330
and we will be working with the entire dataset.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,135
Although pandas is fine for experimenting,

4
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:13,610
for operationalization of your workflow,

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,645
it is better to do preprocessing using Apache Beam and Cloud Dataflow.

6
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:20,720
Go ahead and get started in the lab,

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,875
and my colleague, Lak,

8
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,170
will walk you through the solution.
