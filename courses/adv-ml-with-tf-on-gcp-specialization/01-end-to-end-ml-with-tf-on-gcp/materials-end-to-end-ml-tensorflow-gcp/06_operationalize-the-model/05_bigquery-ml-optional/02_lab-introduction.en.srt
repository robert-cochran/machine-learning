00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,960
In this lab, we're going to continue
with the babyweight dataset that you've

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,030
seen before.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,980
We'll do the model training, evaluation,
and prediction all within BigQuery.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,970
Go ahead and start in the lab and then
we'll walk through the solution together.
