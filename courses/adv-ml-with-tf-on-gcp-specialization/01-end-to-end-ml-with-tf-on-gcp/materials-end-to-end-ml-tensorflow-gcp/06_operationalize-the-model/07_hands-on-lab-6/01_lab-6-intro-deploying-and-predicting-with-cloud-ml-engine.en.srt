00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Now that we have talked about the mechanics of deploying a model to Google Cloud,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,785
let's do a hands-on lab where we get to deploy

3
00:00:07,785 --> 00:00:13,480
our baby weight model to ML Engine and get predictions from it via a rest API.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,000
In this lab, you will do the following tasks: Deploy a trained model to

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,130
Cloud ML Engine and then send a JSON request containing your features to the model,

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,165
so you can get your predictions.

7
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:30,640
Try modifying your input features and see how the results change.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,460
Let's go ahead and get started.
