Now that we have talked about the mechanics of deploying a model to Google Cloud, let's do a hands-on lab where we get to deploy our baby weight model to ML Engine and get predictions from it via a rest API. In this lab, you will do the following tasks: Deploy a trained model to Cloud ML Engine and then send a JSON request containing your features to the model, so you can get your predictions. Try modifying your input features and see how the results change. Let's go ahead and get started.
