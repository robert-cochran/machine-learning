What filter do you use to hash on? You want it to be randomly spread throughout. You cannot split by year because babies' weights actually have a long term trend. Check it out. It's in the data. I'd suggest a concatenated string of year and month. In this lab, you sample the full BigQuery dataset to create a smaller dataset for model development and for local training. Make sure that the smaller dataset is representative of the full dataset.
