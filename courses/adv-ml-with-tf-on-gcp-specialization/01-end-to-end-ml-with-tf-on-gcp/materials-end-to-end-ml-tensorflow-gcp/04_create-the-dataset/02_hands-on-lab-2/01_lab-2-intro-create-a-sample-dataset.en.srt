1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,465
What filter do you use to hash on?

2
00:00:02,465 --> 00:00:05,645
You want it to be randomly spread throughout.

3
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:11,520
You cannot split by year because babies' weights actually have a long term trend.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,500
Check it out. It's in the data.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,340
I'd suggest a concatenated string of year and month.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,225
In this lab, you sample the full BigQuery dataset to create

7
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:25,680
a smaller dataset for model development and for local training.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,750
Make sure that the smaller dataset is representative of the full dataset.
